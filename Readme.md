## Challenges and Solutions

### API Integration
- **Challenge**: Handling the asynchronous nature of API calls and managing the data state.
- **Solution**: Used Axios for API requests and React's useState and useEffect hooks to manage data fetching and state updates efficiently.

### Responsive Design
- **Challenge**: Ensuring the application is responsive across various devices.
- **Solution**: Utilized Bootstrap's grid system and responsive classes to create a fluid and adaptable layout.

### User Session Management
- **Challenge**: Preserving user state and managing sessions.
- **Solution**: Implemented session management using localStorage and React context API for state management.
